# Unit3GroceryAppBackend

* NodeJS, Mongoose, MongoDB, ReactJS, Bootstrap.
* We setup a basic backend together as a basic sketch of the routes.  Then we made the frontend with all components in the main App.  We then broke functionalities out into components, created routes, and added styles.
* A user can log groceries along with their expirations dates.  Also, they can get recipes and nutrition informaton related to their items.
* With more time and depending on the goal, it might make sense to clean the project up and make sure it can handle certain odd cases a user might try.  Or, add more functionality.
